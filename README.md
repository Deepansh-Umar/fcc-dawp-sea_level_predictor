# Sea Level Predictor

This project analyzes global average sea level change data from 1880 to the present. Using data from the **EPA**, we create visualizations and predictions to estimate sea level rise through the year **2050**.

## 📊 Objective

- Analyze sea level data using **Pandas**.
- Visualize historical data with **Matplotlib**.
- Fit and plot **two linear regression models**:
  - One using the entire dataset (1880–present).
  - One using only data from 2000 onward.
- Predict and visualize future sea level trends through **2050**.

## 📁 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `epa-sea-level.csv` | Source data file from the EPA with yearly sea level data. |
| `sea_level_predictor.py` | Main script that reads the data, performs analysis, creates the plot, and saves it. |
| `main.py` | Used for testing and running the main function during development. |
| `test_module.py` | Contains unit tests to validate correctness of the implementation. |
| `sea_level_plot.png` | Output plot generated by the script. |

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Import data** using Pandas from `epa-sea-level.csv`.
2. **Create a scatter plot** of `Year` vs `CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level`.
3. **Calculate and plot a line of best fit** (linear regression) using:
   - All available data (1880–present).
   - Data from 2000 to the most recent year.
4. **Extend both lines** to **2050** to visualize future sea level rise.
5. **Add labels and title**:
   - **X-axis**: Year
   - **Y-axis**: Sea Level (inches)
   - **Title**: Rise in Sea Level
